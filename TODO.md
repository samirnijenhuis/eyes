# The Idea
The idea/project is based on [http://arguseyes.io/](), a tool used for visual image regression on your local dev with a nice output.
   Since the project is not maintaned anymore, the code contains bugs and ran too slow and only on one browser I figured I wanted to recreate this. With the power of Laravel, Dusk and Imagick I managed to recreate the project and even better.
